# pairtrading
Python code for my pair trading program.  Takes in scraped Bloomberg data from Excel and goes through statistics normalization &amp; cointegration tests to find suitable pairs.  Connected to a Streamlit dashboard script that shows price plots and results (buy/sell signals for a pair of securities).
